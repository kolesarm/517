# ECO517: Econometric Theory I: Overview

This half-course constitutes the first six weeks in a first-year graduate
econometric sequence. After reviewing basic probability concepts, it provides
the basic tools for large-sample analysis in econometrics, and sets up a
decision-theoretic framework that allows us to think about estimation and
testing in a rigorous way. You will use these tools throughout the remainder of
the first year and beyond. We also cover some foundational results that are
important in their own right, such as the complete class theorem.

For Princeton students, homework and solutions to it will be posted on Canvas.
Official course description is at the [Registrar's website](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1252&courseid=001446).

# Notes

This repository provides detailed lecture notes with references. They aim to be
self-contained, so they can also serve as a reference in your later graduate
work. As such, a textbook is not needed to survive this course. If your course
goal is more ambitious than that, it is useful to buy one a the three textbooks
listed in the syllabus so that you can get a different perspective on the
material covered.
