# ECO517: Econometric Theory I: Overview

This half-course constitutes the first six weeks in a first-year graduate
econometric sequence. After reviewing basic probability concepts, it provides
the basic tools for large-sample analysis in econometrics, and sets up a
decision-theoretic framework that allows us to think about estimation and
testing in a rigorous way. You will use these tools throughout the remainder of
the first year and beyond. We also cover some foundational results that are
important in their own right, such as the complete class theorem.

For Princeton students, homework and solutions to it will be posted on Canvas.
Official course description is at the [Registrar's website](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1252&courseid=001446).

# Notes

This repository provides detailed lecture notes with references. They aim to be
self-contained, so they can also serve as a reference in your later graduate
work. As such, a textbook is not needed to survive this course. If your course
goal is more ambitious than that, it is useful to buy one a the three textbooks
listed in the syllabus so that you can get a different perspective on the
material covered.

# Topics

1. Probability review: probability spaces, random variables, transformations of
   random variables, quantiles, expectations, independence, covariance, the
   multivariate normal distribution [Notes](eco517_l1.pdf)
2. Convergence, law of large numbers, central limit theorem, delta method
   [Notes](eco517_l2.pdf)
3. Statistical decision theory, game theory, and expected utility.
   Admissibility, unbiasedness, minimax risk, asymptotic properties of
   estimators [Notes](eco517_l3.pdf)
4. Sufficient statistics, factorization theorem, Rao-Blackwell theorem
   [Notes](eco517_l4.pdf)
5. Maximum likelihood, Fisher information, the information (Cram√©r-Rao) bound,
   and the method of moments. [Notes](eco517_l5.pdf)
6. Large-sample properties of maximum likelihood estimators. Maximum likelihood
   is asymptotically normal. It is also asymptotically minimax.
   [Notes](eco517_l6.pdf)
7. Bayesian concepts. Complete class theorem. A good frequentist agrees with at
   least one Bayesian in finite samples; no frequentist is allowed to make fun
   of any non-dogmatic Bayesian. [Notes](eco517_l7.pdf)
8. Testing concepts. [Notes](eco517_l8.pdf)
9. Testing in small samples. Neyman-Pearson lemma. Unbiased tests.
   [Notes](eco517_l9.pdf)
10. Testing in large samples. Wald, Score and likelihood ratio tests are
    asymptotically chi-squared. They are also asymptotically optimal. [Notes](eco517_l10.pdf)
11. Confidence sets. Bernstein-von Mises theorem. All good frequentists and
    non-dogmatic Bayesians agree in large samples. [Notes](eco517_l11.pdf)
